# Installation🔧
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Skardyy/Rhiza
cd rhiza
cargo run --release -- install
```

# Usage💡
### Crawl
```sh
rhz crawl
```
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61b4cee4-70f5-4f0d-9e24-a7b06efacd4a

to find potential apps to link (walks recursively)
defaults:
* ~\Desktop
* ~\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu
* C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu
there are more filtering and logic to prompt the user only for relevant apps to link
  
you will be prompted for new apps you didn't link to before (apps you said no before won't be prompted again)
  
you can also
```sh
rhz crawl -p "/path/to/dir"
```

### Add
you can search for a single app across the entire file-system
```sh
rhz add
```
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fad0bf8-0390-4471-a5c4-39f9d0c22117

### View
you can view all linked apps and their config
```
rhz view
```
it will print it in a formatted json

### Edit
or maybe you want to edit the config
```
rhz edit
```
it will open the ~/.rhiza/ folder where you can:
* delete the bat files from the bin dir (what is called to open the shortcut)
* delete the url/lnk file from the src dir (what the bat file is pointing to)
* edit the config to not automatically re add the deleted items

### Run
finally you can create the lnk files using
```
rhz run
```
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3e529c3-fbc7-45dd-80f8-341c012fecaa

it will create the bin and src files and allow you to use your shortcuts in the shell and in the widnows menu! (`⊞ Win`)
